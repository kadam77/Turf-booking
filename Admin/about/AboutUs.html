    <h1><u class="head1">What is turf?</u></h1>
    <p>
        Nowadays all kinds of sports are played at all times of the year and in all types of weather – whether in natural or controlled environments, outdoors or indoors, on grass, snow, ice or artificial fields. This is possible largely because of the advancement of modern technology that has provided creative solutions for all weather- and setting-related difficulties experienced in the past.
        Synthetic sports turf, also known as artificial grass for sports, is manufactured from synthetic fibers and made to imitate natural grass. It is generally used to provide an adequate surface for sports that are normally played on grass in areas where grass cannot grow or is too difficult to maintain. Artificial turf is used mainly in sports stadiums and arenas, but can also be found on playgrounds, residential lawns, and various other spaces.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Indoor athletic fields are well protected from the whims of the weather but do not get enough sunlight for grass to thrive.
            </li>
            <li>
                Outdoor natural fields – grass fields, in particular – can easily deteriorate due to adverse climatic conditions. As a result, games and matches are often cancelled or hindered.
